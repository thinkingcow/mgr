# mgr
Port of the ancient (~1989) "mgr" window system to the Raspberry Pi

Mgr was a window system originally written for Sun 2/120 workstations in the mid to late 1980's.  I found a "snapshot" of the code from 1989, and thought a port to a modern Linux system (e.g. Raspberry Pi) would be a good waste of time
